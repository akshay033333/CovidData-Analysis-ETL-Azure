The project aimed to build a comprehensive data engineering pipeline to ingest, process, and analyze COVID-19 data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and other relevant sources. The solution leveraged various Azure services,Azure HDInsight including Data Factory, Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Databricks, and Power BI.

**Data Ingestion**:
- Multiple COVID-19 datasets were ingested from the ECDC website and Azure Blob Storage into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 using Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines.
- ADF activities like Copy, Validation, and Get Metadata were utilized to extract data from HTTP sources and Azure Storage into the data lake.
- Datasets included cases and deaths, hospital admissions, testing data, and population data for EU countries.

**Data Transformation**:
- The ingested data underwent transformations using ADF Data Flows, Azure HDInsight, and Azure Databricks.
- Transformations included data cleansing, filtering, joining, sorting, conditional splitting, and deriving new columns.
- Azure Databricks was employed for advanced data processing and machine learning model training to predict COVID-19 spread.

**Data Storage and Analysis**:
- The transformed data was loaded into an Azure SQL Database for storage and analysis.
- Power BI was integrated to visualize the data, generate reports, and provide insights into COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing statistics across the European region.

**Monitoring and Management**:
- The entire data pipeline was monitored and managed through Azure Data Factory's monitoring capabilities and Azure Monitor.
- Triggers and schedules were set up to automate the data ingestion and transformation processes.

The solution demonstrated how Azure Data Factory, in conjunction with other Azure services, can be leveraged to build a robust data engineering pipeline for ingesting, transforming, and analyzing complex datasets like COVID-19 data. The insights derived from this pipeline could aid in understanding the pandemic's impact, forecasting future trends, and supporting data-driven decision-making processes.
